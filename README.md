# Farming In The Jefferson Years

I created this game in 2018, during the time that I was in AP Programming A, a time before my teacher taught me what a "class" or "array" was. My US History teacher created this game to show how much of a gamble farming used to be during the Westward Expansion, and I decided to port it to Java in one day, over nine long hours. This game is a simple one. Just buy some livestock or seeds and hope that you can make a profit by selling your items at the end of the year after prices have fluctuated. However, unlike in a stock market simulator where prices fluctuate for everyone, the prices that you, the farmer, must pay to buy livestock and seeds each year are fixed. I wish you good luck, farmer, for you are going to need it.
